                        <p>The Audi Q4 E-Tron compact electric SUV first debuted at the 2019
                            Geneva Motor Show, andâ€¦ frankly, a whole lot has
                            happened between now and then. Yet, despite all that, what we first saw in Switzerland
                            doesn't seem to have changed
                            all
                            that much between the concept and the production model, and new information from Audi shows
                            just how clever this
                            little
                            EV will be, whether it involves the windshield or just some cup holders.</p>

                        <h2>High style, high function</h2>

                        <p>Audi on Tuesday unleashed a slew of information about the upcoming Q4 E-Tron, including its camouflaged production
                        exterior. As was promised back at its concept debut, the version that will actually reach showrooms doesn't look all
                        that different from what was seen at the last Geneva show. Its compact proportions are a little on the stubby side,
                        thanks to a wheelbase of about 9.1 feet, but all that space between the wheels means the interior is much larger --
                        about that of an Audi Q7, and its cargo area offers as much space as the segment above this one. If you're familiar with
                        any of Audi's other E-Tron models, the styling shouldn't come as much of a surprise.
                        
                        <br><br>

                        The exterior teasers are just a small part of what Audi offered up. Most of the focus was placed on the Q4 E-Tron's
                        interior. Thanks to a flat load floor and by-wire controls for the transmission, the Q4 E-Tron's center console is like
                        nothing else Audi makes, with a higher protuberance containing the start button and transmission controls, leaving gobs
                        of space underneath for wireless device charging, USB-C ports and a pair of cup holders, with a traditional
                        under-armrest cubby hanging out between the seats, as well. Speaking of beverage storage, all four door panels have a
                        unique high-mounted bottle holder just ahead of the window switches for easier access to drinks measuring up to 1 liter.</p>

                        <br><hr><br>

                        <p>The HUD is split into two sections. The primary head-up display area covers the usual stuff like vehicle speed, as well
                        as speed limit and driver-assist information, at a perceived distance to the driver of about 10 feet. The AR segment can
                        show turning arrows, navigation destinations and a green line to denote the position of the vehicle ahead, and all that
                        stuff is displayed at a perceived distance of about 33 feet, so that the driver can clearly differentiate between the
                        two kinds of information being sent their way.

                        <br><br>
                        
                        It's quite the complicated dance to get this all to work. A picture generation unit tucked into the dashboard uses a
                        bright LCD screen that projects onto two different mirrors, which bounce off a concave mirror to display on two separate
                        areas of the windshield -- the "near" and "far" portions mentioned earlier. Cameras, radar sensors and GPS provide data
                        to the Q4 E-Tron's computers, which calculate where to place AR objects and how to reposition them in the event of
                        braking, potholes or any other occurrences that may cause the vehicle to move unexpectedly. Some 600,000 lines of code
                        are required to pull it off. It's impressive stuff, and we can't wait to see how it works in person.

                        <br><br>
                        
                        We don't have to wait too much longer to see the whole shebang. Audi intends to unveil the Q4 E-Tron in its full
                        production guise in April.</p>
